# typewriter

Creating a 'typewriter'eqsue setTimeout for practice.

Takes in a sentence, and loops over each letter - each letter will then be printed out 50 seconds apart. 
The final piece was to add a new line after the sentence has been printed, so this is called only if
the sentence length has been finished (it too prints 50 seconds after the last letter in the sentence).
